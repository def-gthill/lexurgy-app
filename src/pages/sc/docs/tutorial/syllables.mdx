# Lexurgy Sound Changer Tutorial — Using Syllables

Lexurgy understands that words can be broken down into syllables. It offers two approaches for working with syllables: [manual syllables](#manual) and [automatic syllables](#automatic)

## Manual Syllables|manual

The IPA uses the period (`.`) to mark syllable breaks. You can put `.` characters in your input words to show where the syllable breaks are. But by default, Lexurgy treats `.` as a sound like any other:

<ScExample
  changes={`class vowel {a, e, i, o, u}\n\nvoicing:\n  {p, t, k} => {b, d, ɡ} / @vowel _ @vowel`}
  inputs={["kiki", "papa", "ki.ki", "pa.pa"]}
/>

The words with the `.` characters in them aren't affected by the `voicing` rule, since the "sound" before the stop is `.`, not a vowel.

But as soon as you provide a `syllables` rule, this changes:

<ScExample
  changes={`class vowel {a, e, i, o, u}\n\nsyllables:\n  explicit\n\nvoicing:\n  {p, t, k} => {b, d, ɡ} / @vowel _ @vowel`}
  inputs={["kiki", "papa", "ki.ki", "pa.pa"]}
/>

This sets syllables to `explicit` (i.e. manual) mode. Now the `.` characters are treated as syllable breaks, not sounds, which means they no longer disrupt adjacency.

Once you're done with syllables, you can `clear` them:

<ScExample
  changes={`class vowel {a, e, i, o, u}\n\nsyllables:\n  explicit\n\nvoicing:\n  {p, t, k} => {b, d, ɡ} / @vowel _ @vowel\n\nsyllables:\n  clear`}
  inputs={["ki.ki", "pa.pa"]}
/>
