# Lexurgy Sound Changer How To

## Stress Assignment|stress-assignment

Stress is usually best expressed as a [syllable-level feature](/sc/docs/tutorial/syllables#features) with a ["before" diacritic](/sc/docs/tutorial/features#diacritics). Then you can use an ordinary rule to assign stress:

<ScExample
  changes={
    "feature (syllable) +stress\ndiacritic ˈ (before) [+stress]\nclass vowel {a, e, i, o, u}\nclass cons {p, t, k, s, m, n, l, r}\n\nsyllables:\n  @cons? :: @vowel :: @cons?\n\nstress-last-syllable:\n  <syl> => [+stress] / _ $"
  }
  inputs={["kiki", "sanitsa", "miskopun"]}
/>

In this case, the stress rule is simple—always stress the last syllable—so the stress assignment rule is also simple.

For more complex stress rules, one approach is:

1. Use [syllable-level feature assignment](/sc/docs/tutorial/syllables#assigning-features) to assign temporary weight features to each syllable.
2. Use [hierarchical blocks](/sc/docs/reference#blocks) to assign stress based on the weight features.
3. Remove the weight features and reset the syllable structure.

Suppose that you want a word to be stressed on the last long vowel if one exists; otherwise on the last closed syllable if one exists; otherwise on the last syllable. You can write this as follows:

<ScExample
  changes={
    "feature +long\nfeature (syllable) +stress\nfeature (syllable) +longsyl\nfeature (syllable) +codasyl\ndiacritic ˈ (before) [+stress]\ndiacritic ː (floating) [+long]\ndiacritic • [+longsyl]\ndiacritic ≈ [+codasyl]\nclass vowel {a, e, i, o, u}\nclass cons {p, t, k, s, m, n, l}\n\nsyllables:\n  @cons? :: @vowel&[+long] :: @cons? =>\n    [+longsyl]\n  @cons? :: @vowel :: @cons =>\n    [+codasyl]\n  @cons? :: @vowel\n\nassign-stress:\n  <syl>&[+longsyl] => [+stress] /\n    _ (<syl>&[-longsyl])* $\n  else:\n  <syl>&[+codasyl] => [+stress] /\n    _ (<syl>&[-codasyl])* $\n  else:\n  <syl> => [+stress] / _ $\n\nremove-weight:\n  [+longsyl] => [-longsyl]\n  [+codasyl] => [-codasyl]\n\nsyllables:\n  @cons? :: @vowel :: @cons?"
  }
  inputs={["saːnitsa", "sanitsa", "sanisa"]}
/>

## Breaking the Rules|turing-completeness

Lexurgy is meant for simulating how natural languages evolve, so its features are tailored to that use case. But Lexurgy is also [Turing complete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness); with the right rules, it can perform arbitrary computations. Even if your sound changes are highly unusual, Lexurgy can represent them.

Suppose that you want to change all instances of `a` into `e`, but only in words with an odd number of phonemes. This is probably impossible in human languages, but maybe it makes sense for your project. Lexurgy has no built-in way to count the number of phonemes in a word, but you can still write a rule that does this:

<ScExample
  changes={`feature +oddpos\ndiacritic ^ [+oddpos]\n\nadd-oddpos:\n  [] => [+oddpos] / $ _\n  then ltr:\n  [] => [+oddpos] / [+oddpos] [] _\n\nkeep-only-odds:\n  [+oddpos] => [-oddpos] // _ $\n\na-to-e:\n  a^ => e^\n  a => e / _ []* [+oddpos]\n\nremove-oddpos:\n  [+oddpos] => [-oddpos]`}
  inputs={["haha", "haaha", "hahat", "hahahahaha", "hahahaahaha"]}
/>

This works as follows:

1. Add a temporary diacritic `^` to the first sound in the word.
2. Scanning from left to right, add a `^` _two sounds to the right_ of each existing `^`. This puts a `^` on _every second_ sound, starting with the first.
3. Remove all `^` _except_ on the last segment of the word. Since `^` occurs only on sounds in an odd position, it can only occur on the last sound if the word has an odd number of sounds.
4. Change `a` to `e` only in words that have a `^` in them.
5. Remove all `^` diacritics.

Make sure to use "Trace Changes" if you find this confusing. This rule removes all the temporary diacritics to cover its tracks, but "Trace Changes" reveals exactly what they're doing.

As this example shows, the key is usually to add _temporary symbols_ (often diacritics) and use Lexurgy's iterative constructs (`propagate`, `ltr`, and `rtl`).

Just to show how powerful this can be, here are some Lexurgy rules that _perform addition_:

<ScExample
  changes={`class digit {\\0, \\1, \\2, \\3, \\4, \\5, \\6, \\7, \\8, \\9}\nclass inc {\\1, \\2, \\3, \\4, \\5, \\6, \\7, \\8, \\9, '\\0}\n\nline-up-digits propagate:\n  | @digit$1 \\+ @digit$2 => $2 | $1 \\+ / _ @digit\n  then:\n  @digit$1 \\+ @digit$2 * * => \\+ $2 | $1 \\+ / _ @digit // | _\n\nadd-one-digit propagate:\n  @digit \\+ @inc => @inc \\+ @digit\n  \\+0 => *\n\nremove-signs:\n  {|, \\+} => *\n\ncarry propagate:\n  @digit ' => @inc *\n  ' => \\1 / $ _`}
  inputs={[
    "1+1",
    "2+9",
    "3+3",
    "3+0",
    "11+5",
    "15+6",
    "11+12",
    "15+16",
    "52+87",
    "100+25",
    "25+100",
    "111+222",
    "216+729",
    "1111+2222",
    "2468+8642",
    "31415+27182",
    "88888+11112",
  ]}
/>

Again, use "Trace Changes" if you find this confusing.
